# Marigold: Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Monocular Depth Estimation (+DIODE Fine-Tuning)

This repository represents the official implementation of the paper titled "Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Monocular Depth Estimation" and is set up to be further trained with the DIODE dataset.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

The training and inference code were tested on:

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.10.12,  CUDA 12.1, GeForce RTX 3090 (pip, Mamba)

### üì¶ Repository

Clone the repository (requires git):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DmytroIvakhnenkov/MarigoldDIODE.git
cd MarigoldDIODE
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Inference settings

The default settings are optimized for the best result. However, the behavior of the code can be customized:

- Trade-offs between the **accuracy** and **speed** (for both options, larger values result in better accuracy at the cost of slower inference.)
  - `--ensemble_size`: Number of inference passes in the ensemble. For LCM `ensemble_size` is more important than `denoise_steps`. Default: ~~10~~ 5 (for LCM).
  - `--denoise_steps`: Number of denoising steps of each inference pass. For the original (DDIM) version, it's recommended to use 10-50 steps, while for LCM 1-4 steps. When unassigned (`None`), will read default setting from model config. Default: ~~10 4 (for LCM)~~ `None`.

- By default, the inference script resizes input images to the *processing resolution*, and then resizes the prediction back to the original resolution. This gives the best quality, as Stable Diffusion, from which Marigold is derived, performs best at 768x768 resolution.  
  
  - `--processing_res`: the processing resolution; set as 0 to process the input resolution directly. When unassigned (`None`), will read default setting from model config. Default: ~~768~~ `None`.
  - `--output_processing_res`: produce output at the processing resolution instead of upsampling it to the input resolution. Default: False.
  - `--resample_method`: the resampling method used to resize images and depth predictions. This can be one of `bilinear`, `bicubic`, or `nearest`. Default: `bilinear`.

- `--half_precision` or `--fp16`: Run with half-precision (16-bit float) to have faster speed and reduced VRAM usage, but might lead to suboptimal results.
- `--seed`: Random seed can be set to ensure additional reproducibility. Default: None (unseeded). Note: forcing `--batch_size 1` helps to increase reproducibility. To ensure full reproducibility, [deterministic mode](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html#avoiding-nondeterministic-algorithms) needs to be used.
- `--batch_size`: Batch size of repeated inference. Default: 0 (best value determined automatically).
- `--color_map`: [Colormap](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html) used to colorize the depth prediction. Default: Spectral. Set to `None` to skip colored depth map generation.
- `--apple_silicon`: Use Apple Silicon MPS acceleration.

### ‚¨á Checkpoint cache

Use the following script to download the checkpoint weights locally:

```bash
bash script/download_weights.sh marigold-v1-0
# or LCM checkpoint
bash script/download_weights.sh marigold-lcm-v1-0
```

At inference, specify the checkpoint path:

```bash
python run.py \
    --checkpoint checkpoint/marigold-v1-0 \
    --denoise_steps 50 \
    --ensemble_size 10 \
    --input_rgb_dir input/in-the-wild_example\
    --output_dir output/in-the-wild_example
```

## ü¶ø Evaluation on test datasets <a name="evaluation"></a>

Install additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements+.txt -r requirements.txt
```

Set data directory variable (also needed in evaluation scripts) and download [evaluation datasets](https://share.phys.ethz.ch/~pf/bingkedata/marigold/evaluation_dataset) into corresponding subfolders:

```bash
export BASE_DATA_DIR=<YOUR_DATA_DIR>  # Set target data directory

wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=4 -R "index.html*" -P ${BASE_DATA_DIR} https://share.phys.ethz.ch/~pf/bingkedata/marigold/evaluation_dataset/
```

Run inference and evaluation scripts, for example:

```bash
# Run inference
bash script/eval/11_infer_nyu.sh

# Evaluate predictions
bash script/eval/12_eval_nyu.sh
```

Note: although the seed has been set, the results might still be slightly different on different hardware.

## üèãÔ∏è Training

Based on the previously created environment, install extended requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements++.txt -r requirements+.txt -r requirements.txt
```

Set environment parameters for the data directory:

```bash
export BASE_DATA_DIR=YOUR_DATA_DIR  # directory of training data
export BASE_CKPT_DIR=YOUR_CHECKPOINT_DIR  # directory of pretrained checkpoint
```

Run training script

```bash
python train.py --config config/train_marigold.yaml
```

Resume from a checkpoint, e.g.

```bash
python train.py --resume_from output/marigold_base/checkpoint/latest
```

Evaluating results

Only the U-Net is updated and saved during training. To use the inference pipeline with your training result, replace `unet` folder in Marigold checkpoints with that in the `checkpoint` output folder. Then refer to [this section](#evaluation) for evaluation.

**Note**: Although random seeds have been set, the training result might be slightly different on different hardwares. It's recommended to train without interruption.
